    "a_p2": "I am a second-year student at Smíchovská Secondary Technical School and Gymnasium, studying Information Technology with a focus on programming. I have experience with the Unity game engine, programming in languages like C#, HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript, and I'm willing to continue developing my skills. I enjoy playing the piano, going to the theater, cooking, and solving logic puzzles. In group projects, I usually take on the role of leader and take responsibility for the whole team. At the moment, I’m trying to discover myself by exploring different fields, hobbies, and figuring out what I enjoy the most. I enjoy meeting new people and building friendly relationships, and I’m not afraid to take the first step. One small detail to add – I prefer tea over coffee.",
